# CTransform
## Complex functions applied to images

This project was inspired by a Welch Labs video on complex functions (specifically, [this one](https://youtu.be/pNp8Qf20-sA?list=PLiaHhY2iBX9g6KIvZ_703G3KJXapKkNaF) at around the 6 minute mark onwards).

The goal is to create an API that will allow for more ease at creating these sorts of transformations on both static images and videos.

## Dependencies
Current dependencies are:

* PIL
* NumPy

Though these may change as the project moves onward.
